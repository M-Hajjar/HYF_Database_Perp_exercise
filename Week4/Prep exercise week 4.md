# Converting a Normalized SQL Database to a Document-Based NoSQL Database

## 1. Overview

In the previous exercise, we normalized a relational database designed to store food recipes, ensuring it adhered to Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF). This week, the focus is on converting that normalized SQL database into a document-based NoSQL database using MongoDB.

## 2. Defining Collections

In a document-based NoSQL database like MongoDB, data is stored in collections instead of tables. Each collection will represent a different entity from the original SQL database.

### Collections:
1. **Recipes**
2. **Categories**
3. **Ingredients**

## 3. Embedding vs. Normalization in NoSQL

In NoSQL databases, some data can be embedded directly within a document, which reduces the need for joins and can simplify queries. However, it's important to balance embedding with normalization to avoid excessive data duplication and to maintain flexibility.

### Embedding Strategy

1. **Recipes Collection**:
    - **Embedded Data**:
        - **Ingredients**: The list of ingredients specific to the recipe will be embedded within the recipe document. Each ingredient will include details like quantity and measurement.
        - **Steps**: The steps required to prepare the recipe will also be embedded as an array of steps, maintaining the order in which they should be performed.
    - **Normalized Data**:
        - **Category References**: Categories will remain a separate collection, with the `Recipes` collection storing references (IDs) to the relevant categories. This allows for easy categorization and filtering without duplicating category data across multiple recipes.

    ```json
    {
        "_id": "recipe_id",
        "name": "Recipe Name",
        "ingredients": [
            { "ingredient_id": "ingredient_id", "name": "Ingredient Name", "quantity": "1", "measurement": "cup" },
            { "ingredient_id": "ingredient_id", "name": "Ingredient Name", "quantity": "2", "measurement": "tbsp" }
        ],
        "steps": [
            { "step_number": 1, "description": "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F" },
            { "step_number": 2, "description": "Mix flour and sugar" }
        ],
        "category_ids": ["category_id_1", "category_id_2"]
    }
    ```

2. **Categories Collection**:
    - **Stored Separately**: Categories will be stored as separate documents within the `Categories` collection. Each category document will contain an array of recipe IDs that belong to that category. This ensures that category data remains consistent and easy to manage.

    ```json
    {
        "_id": "category_id",
        "name": "Dessert",
        "recipe_ids": ["recipe_id_1", "recipe_id_2"]
    }
    ```

3. **Ingredients Collection**:
    - **Stored Separately**: While individual recipes will have embedded ingredients, the `Ingredients` collection will store ingredient details like nutritional information or common usage. This allows for easy updating and management of ingredients across recipes.

    ```json
    {
        "_id": "ingredient_id",
        "name": "Flour",
        "nutritional_info": {
            "calories": 100,
            "protein": "3g"
        }
    }
    ```

## 4. Considerations for Scaling

As the database grows to include thousands of recipes:
- **Performance**: Embedding ingredients and steps within the `Recipes` collection can enhance read performance since all related data is retrieved in a single query.
- **Storage**: Properly balancing embedding and references ensures efficient storage, preventing redundant data while maintaining data consistency.
- **Data Integrity**: By keeping categories and ingredients in separate collections with references, it becomes easier to update and manage data without causing inconsistencies.

## 5. Conclusion

Converting a normalized SQL database into a document-based NoSQL database requires thoughtful consideration of when to embed data and when to maintain separate collections. This approach optimizes performance and scalability while ensuring the database remains flexible and easy to manage as it grows.

By strategically embedding ingredients and steps within the `Recipes` collection and using references for categories, the NoSQL design captures the benefits of both normalization and the document-oriented structure, making it well-suited for handling complex queries and large datasets.
